# Socket.IO chat

This is a realtime chat application project to learn ``socket.io``.

I'm watching [here](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) to learn and to create.

I'm challenging homework. And the homework is displayed on the bottom of this [page](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/).

## Homework

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

* Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
* Add support for nicknames
* Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
* Add “{user} is typing” functionality
* Show who’s online
* Add private messaging
* Share your improvements!
